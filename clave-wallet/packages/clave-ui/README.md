# Clave UI

Clave Design System (CDS) is the core design system behind our Mobile Applications. This technical document specifies the components and guidelines for using the React Native library.

## Installation

Currently, since we are in monorepo, you can add `clave-ui` to your dependencies to use the existing components from CDS.

```json
{
	"dependencies": {
        ...
        "clave-ui": "*",
	}
}
```

```md
Additionally, to use the `CDSIcons` you should download the `react-native-svg` and install the pods.
```

## Documentation

The documentation for the UI library is still in progress. However, you can access the existing documentation from [Notion.](https://www.notion.so/getclave/CDS-React-Native-fd10852a754b47ca8f927d2ec5fc0339?pvs=4)

## Tests

You can run tests on components by running a default test command, which is specified below:

```bash
$ npm run test
```
